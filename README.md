#The method used for the PrintOutput function was simply using print of any string wanted.
#The method used for the LoadFile function was the headlines function within a with loop of a file.
#The method used for the UpdateString function was making a list out of the original string so it could be mutable and then changing at the desired index then returning it as a string with the join function.
#The method used for the FindWordCount was using a for loop to iterate over the the list of strings and comparing the indexed strings with a given string and adding to the count each time it was the same (if statement).
#The method used for the ScoreFinder was using a for loop for the player name and checking if the indexed item was equal to the string. Using an if statement, if the indexed item was the string then that index was used as the index for the second list item at that index to be saved as the score.
#The method used for the Union function was iterating over one list and adding the index items of the other list if they were not equal. This creates a exclusive list of shared values.
#The method used for the Intersection function was creating a new list and iterating over one of the original lists along with checking if the indexed item in the other list. This item was then appended to the list.
#The method used for the NotIn function was creating a new list and checking each iteration of one loop and if it was anywhere in the other loop. If it wasn't, the indexed item was added to the new list
